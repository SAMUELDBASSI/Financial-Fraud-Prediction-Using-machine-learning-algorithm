# Financial-Fraud-Prediction-Using-machine-learning-algorithm 
This project aim to identify financial fraud with machine learning, we need to train a machine learning model for classifying fraudulent and non-fraudulent transaction. For this project , I need a dataset containing information about financial fraud, so that we can understand what type of transactions lead to fraud. For this task, I collected a dataset from Kaggle, which contains historical information about fraudulent transactions which can be used to detect financial fraud.
# description of features in the dataset

<p>type: type of online transaction</p>
<p>amount: the amount of the transaction</p>
<p>nameOrig: customer starting the transaction</p>
<p>oldbalanceOrg: balance before the transaction</p>
<p>newbalanceOrig: balance after the transaction</p>
<p>nameDest: recipient of the transaction</p>
<p>oldbalanceDest: initial balance of recipient before the transaction</p>
<p>newbalanceDest: the new balance of recipient after the transaction</p>
<p>isFraud: fraud transaction</p>
